Due to insufficiency of proper tourist guide tourist face many problem. As traditional practice when a tourist visits to our country they have to engage professional tourist guide. The guide provides the information about the city. We have to spend handsome amount of money to get such service of a professional guide. It is expensive for most of the tourist. Mostly guides are not professional because they working part time in summer season as guide and in winter they used to work in other fields. So sometimes the guide also could not give
proper information to the travellers because of human nature they canâ€™t remember fact and figures which are requires for decision making like temperature, heights from the sea level, weather conditions, dates and historical importance, etc. As the new technology came this app is provide all the information of the tourists and also there is no need to give any kind of money to the tourist guider .with the help of this app you can able to know the weather ,humidity of that place .and as your comfort of weather you can easily go.
